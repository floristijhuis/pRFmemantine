## Retinotopical analysis of pRF fits
This folder contains two scripts that were used to visualize pRF fits on the brain surfaces of individual subjects. The `TEMPLATE_ROIdrawing.ipynb file` was used to assess the Gaussian pRF fits based on the average fit for both sessions. The `TEMPLATE_flatmap_plac_vs_mem.ipynb` file was used to compare polar angle and eccentricity maps between the two conditions on the flattened surface of each individual subject using the output of the DN model fits.
